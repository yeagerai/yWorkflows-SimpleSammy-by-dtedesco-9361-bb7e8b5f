# Component Name

RandomAdjective

## Description

The RandomAdjective component is a Yeager Workflow building block that selects a random adjective from a provided list of adjectives, which starts with the same letter as the given name. It is a Python class that inherits from the AbstractComponent base class and implements the `transform()` method.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Model

The component accepts input data as an instance of the `RandomAdjectiveInputDict` class, which is a Pydantic BaseModel. It includes the following fields:

- `adjective_list`: A list of strings, where each string is an adjective.
- `name`: A single string that represents a name.

### Output Model

The component returns output data as an instance of the `RandomAdjectiveOutputDict` class, which is another Pydantic BaseModel. It includes the following field:

- `adjective`: A single string that represents the randomly selected adjective.

## Parameters

The `RandomAdjective` class does not have any configurable parameters. All the input data is passed through the `transform()` method, as explained in the next section.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method accepts the input argument as `RandomAdjectiveInputDict` type and returns output as `RandomAdjectiveOutputDict`. The method executes the following steps:

1. Extracts the first letter of the given name and converts it to lowercase.
2. Filters the provided adjective list to include only adjectives starting with the same letter as the name.
3. If no adjectives are found in the filtered list, a ValueError exception is raised.
4. Generates a seed value using the sum of the ASCII values of each character in the given name.
5. Sets the random seed to ensure consistency in random adjective selection across multiple runs with the same input.
6. Selects a random adjective from the filtered list of adjectives.
7. Returns the selected adjective as an instance of `RandomAdjectiveOutputDict`.

## External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

- `FastAPI`: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, used for exposing the API endpoint for the `transform()` function in this component.
- `Pydantic`: A powerful and flexible data validation and serialization library, used for defining the input and output models of the component.

## API Calls

The component does not make any external API calls.

## Error Handling

The component raises a ValueError exception if no adjectives are found starting with the same letter as the given name. The error message includes the missing letter.
