# Component Name

SimpleSammy

# Description

SimpleSammy is a Yeager component designed to process input data and return two types of output data: adjective and combined_name. It is a Python class that inherits from the AbstractWorkflow base class and implements the transform() method.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

NameInput is the input model used in this component, represented by a Pydantic BaseModel. It contains the following fields:

- `name: str` - A string representing a name.

## Output Models

There are two output models for this component represented by Pydantic BaseModels:

1. AdjectiveOutput:

   - `adjective: str` - A string representing an adjective.

2. NameCombinationOutput:

   - `combined_name: str` - A string representing a combined name.

# Parameters

The SimpleSammy class does not have any custom parameters. However, the transform() method has the following parameters:

- `args: NameInput` - An instance of the NameInput model containing input data.
- `callbacks: Any` - A parameter to pass callback functions, if required. By default, it is set to None.

# Transform Function

The transform() method in SimpleSammy performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `super().transform(args=args, callbacks=callbacks)` to apply any predefined transformations from the AbstractWorkflow class.
2. Extracts the adjective and combined_name values from the results dictionary.
3. Constructs instances of AdjectiveOutput and NameCombinationOutput using the extracted data.
4. Returns the instances of AdjectiveOutput and NameCombinationOutput.

# External Dependencies

The SimpleSammy component depends on the following external libraries:

- `typing`: Provides support for type annotations.
- `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables from the .env file.
- `fastapi`: A framework for building APIs, utilized for the SimpleSammy API routing and request handling.
- `pydantic`: Provides the base framework for defining input and output models.

# API Calls

The SimpleSammy component does not make any external API calls.

# Error Handling

No specific error handling is implemented in SimpleSammy, as it relies on the base AbstractWorkflow class for handling errors during the transform() method execution.

# Examples

Here's an example of using the SimpleSammy component in a Yeager Workflow:
