# Component Name

FetchAdjectives

# Description

The FetchAdjectives component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow designed to retrieve and filter positive or neutral adjectives from an external API or a predefined dataset. The output is a dictionary with the first letter of the alphabet as the key, and a list of filtered adjectives as the value.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model:

`FetchAdjectivesInputDict` is an empty class derived from the `BaseModel` and does not contain any fields for input.

## Output Model:

`FetchAdjectivesOutputDict` is a class derived from the `BaseModel`, containing the following fields:

- `adjective_list`: A dictionary with a letter of the alphabet as the key and a list of filtered adjectives as the value. The dictionary follows the structure: `Dict[str, List[str]]`.

# Parameters

The component takes the following parameters:

- `alphabet`: A `str` parameter representing the letters of the alphabet for which the adjectives are fetched.
- `min_adjectives_per_letter`: An `int` parameter specifying the minimum number of adjectives that should be fetched for each letter of the alphabet.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method implements the following steps:

1. Create an empty dictionary called `adjectives_dict` that will store filtered adjectives.
2. Iterate over each letter of the `alphabet`.
3. Call the `fetch_adjectives()` method to retrieve adjectives for that letter.
4. Filter the retrieved adjectives to keep only those that begin with the current `letter`.
5. If the number of filtered adjectives is less than `min_adjectives_per_letter`, fetch more adjectives and append the filtered adjectives to the existing list.
6. Store the filtered adjectives list in the `adjectives_dict` dictionary with the current `letter` as the key.
7. Return the `FetchAdjectivesOutputDict` object with the `adjective_list` attribute as `adjectives_dict`.

# External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external libraries:

- `os`: To access environment variables.
- `yaml`: To parse the YAML configuration file.
- `dotenv`: To load environment variables from a .env file.
- `fastapi`: To create and use the FastAPI endpoint.
- `pydantic`: To create and validate input and output data models.

# API Calls

The `fetch_adjectives()` method in the component is a placeholder for making API calls or retrieving adjectives from a predefined dataset. This method should be replaced with the appropriate API call or dataset retrieval code.

# Error Handling

The component does not have specific error handling mechanisms in place. However, the input and output data validation is performed through the use of Pydantic's `BaseModel`, ensuring that incorrect input data is handled appropriately.

# Examples

The following is an example of how to use the FetchAdjectives component within a Yeager Workflow:
